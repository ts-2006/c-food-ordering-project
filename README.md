# c-food-ordering-project
The Food Ordering System is a simple console-based application developed in C language. It allows users to view a menu, place food orders, generate bills, and manage order details â€” all within a text-based interface. The project demonstrates the use of structures, arrays, functions, conditional statements, and file handling in C.
